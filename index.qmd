::: {.notes}
I'm David Aja, a member of the SE team at RStudio.
I help data scientists get their ideas into production.
I see a lot of broken things.
So that's why today I'll be talking about:

use <br/>
renv.

## `*.Rproj`

```

You don't ship your editor to your teammates.

## `*.Rproj` {transition="none"}

You don't ship your editor to your new laptop.

:::{.notes}
- `.Rproj` is mostly editor config
- signifier but doesn't accomplish proejct goals
- Some RStudio handling of configurable R behaviors, but R doesn't know that
:::


## `*.Rproj`

**necessary**, but not sufficient

# what *is* a project?

::: {.notes}
- we're increasing the diversity of things R can do and where it does them
- behooves us to learn from other language and framework paradigms and how they think about reliably delivering product
- 12 factor is focused on deploying web applications but many lessons translate
:::

## 12 factor 

>  No matter what the toolchain, dependency declaration and isolation must always be used together â€“ only one or the other is not sufficient to satisfy twelve-factor.

## cookiecutter data science

> The first step in reproducing an analysis is always reproducing the computational environment it was run in. 
> You need the same tools, 
> the **same libraries**, 
> and the **same versions** to make everything play nicely together.

::: {.notes}
reproducibility doesn't have to be binary or all-encompassing
reiterating the previous--an analysis that's only runnable on your machine is not as helpful as one that other people can access
:::


# how

headings as isolate? and enumerate?
more definition context?

## `renv::init()`

- creates isolated library
- discovers and installs dependencies from your code

## `install.packages()`

## `renv::status()`

## `renv::snapshot()`

`renv.lock`

## what about `pak`?

## are packages projects?
