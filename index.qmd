#  {background-image="images/julia-joppien-XFUqd0u5U7w-unsplash.jpg"}

::: notes
I'm David Aja, a member of the SE team at RStudio.  
I help data scientists get their ideas into production.  
I see a lot of broken things.  
So that's why today I'll be talking about:
:::

#  {background-image="images/julia-joppien-XFUqd0u5U7w-unsplash.jpg"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: {.r-fit-text color="white"}
You <br/> should <br/> use <br/> renv.

# why

## we have a standards problem

what makes a project an *R* project?
:::

## what is a project?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
> *an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim.*

> -- Oxford Languages
:::

## what is a project?

::: {.fragment .fade-in .r-fit-text}
a project *ships*.

\*.Rproj

## `*.Rproj`

    Version: 1.0

    RestoreWorkspace: Default
    SaveWorkspace: Default
    AlwaysSaveHistory: Default

    UseSpacesForTab: Yes

    Encoding: UTF-8

    AutoAppendNewline: Yes

::: fragment
You don't ship your editor to your clients.

## `*.Rproj` {transition="none"}

    Version: 1.0

    RestoreWorkspace: Default
    SaveWorkspace: Default
    AlwaysSaveHistory: Default

    UseSpacesForTab: Yes
    NumSpacesForTab: 2
    Encoding: UTF-8

    AutoAppendNewline: Yes
    StripTrailingWhitespace: Yes

You don't ship your editor to your teammates.

## `*.Rproj` {transition="none"}

    Version: 1.0

    RestoreWorkspace: Default
    SaveWorkspace: Default
    AlwaysSaveHistory: Default

    UseSpacesForTab: Yes
    NumSpacesForTab: 2
    Encoding: UTF-8

    AutoAppendNewline: Yes
    StripTrailingWhitespace: Yes

You don't ship your editor to your new laptop.

::: notes
-   `.Rproj` is mostly editor config
-   signifier but doesn't accomplish proejct goals
-   Some RStudio handling of configurable R behaviors, but R doesn't know that
:::

## `*.Rproj`

**necessary**, but not sufficient

# what *is* a project?

::: notes
-   we're increasing the diversity of things R can do and where it does them
-   behooves us to learn from other language and framework paradigms and how they think about reliably delivering product
-   12 factor is focused on deploying web applications but many lessons translate
:::

## 12 factor

> A twelve-factor app **never** relies on implicit existence of system-wide packages.

::: columns
::: {.column .fragment width="49%"}
It declares all dependencies, completely and exactly, via a dependency declaration manifest.
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="49%" style="text-align: right;"}
It uses a dependency isolation tool \[...\] to ensure that no implicit dependencies "leak in"
:::

## cookiecutter data science

> The first step in reproducing an analysis is always reproducing the computational environment it was run in. You need the same tools, <br/> the **same libraries**, <br/> and the **same versions** to make everything play nicely together.

::: notes
reproducibility doesn't have to be binary or all-encompassing reiterating the previous--an analysis that's only runnable on your machine is not as helpful as one that other people can access
:::

# how

## 

::: r-fit-text
isolate.

## `renv::init()`
or,

## `install.packages()`

## `renv::status()`

```{.r}
The following package(s) are recorded in the lockfile but not installed:
              _
  R6            [2.5.0]
  Rcpp          [1.0.6]
  askpass       [1.1]
  base64enc     [0.1-3]
  bslib         [0.2.4]

  withr         [2.4.0]
  xtable        [1.8-4]
  yaml          [2.2.1]

Use `renv::restore()` to install these packages.
```

## are packages projects?

kind of.

## feedback:

Kevin:
make sure you call out that projects need lockfiles
what's happening with respect to the private package library
discuss when to call snapshot

Alex:
reverse the motivation so that it's less of an appeal to authority
people need to be shown that it's not that hard

who is this for?
showcase horrors?
mention cache?
